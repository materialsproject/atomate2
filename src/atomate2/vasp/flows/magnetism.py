class MagneticOrderingsMaker(magnetism_flows.MagneticOrderingsMaker):
    """
    Maker to calculate possible collinear magnetic orderings for a material in VASP.

    Given an input structure, possible magnetic orderings will be enumerated and ranked based
    on symmetry up to a maximum number of orderings. Each ordering will be
    relaxed and a higher quality static calculation performed to obtain a total energy.
    The lowest energy ordering is the predicted ground-state collinear ordering.

    This approach performed decently using VASP for a wide range of test materials in a
    benchmark. It was originally implemented in atomate (v1) for VASP as the
    MagneticOrderingsWF.

    .. Note::
        Good performance of this workflow is ultimately dependent on an appropriate
        choice of Hubbard U, Hund J values and/or the functional. The defaults will work
        well for many transition metal oxides.

    Parameters
    ----------
    name : str
        Name of the flows produced by this Maker.
    static_maker : StaticMaker
        Maker used to peform static calculations for total energy.
    relax_maker : RelaxMaker | None
        Maker used to perform relaxations of the enumerated structures. If None,
        relaxations will be skipped (i.e., only static calculations).
    default_magmoms : dict | None
        Optional default mapping of magnetic elements to their initial magnetic moments
        in ÂµB. Generally these are chosen to be high-spin, since they can relax to a
        low-spin configuration during a DFT electronic configuration. If None, will use
        the default values provided in pymatgen/analysis/magnetism/default_magmoms.yaml.
    strategies : tuple
        Different ordering strategies to use. Choose from ferromagnetic,
        antiferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic_by_motif, ferrimagnetic_by_motif,
        ferrimagnetic_by_species, or nonmagnetic. Here, "motif", means to use a
        different ordering parameter for symmetry inequivalent sites.
    automatic : bool
        If True, will automatically choose sensible strategies.
    truncate_by_symmetry : bool
        If True, will remove very unsymmetrical orderings that are likely physically
        implausible.
    transformation_kwargs : dict | None
        Keyword arguments provided to MagOrderingTransformation in pymatgen.

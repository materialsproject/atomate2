    """
    Perform quasi-harmonic approximation.

    First relax a structure using relax_maker.
    Then perform a series of deformations on the relaxed structure, and
    then compute harmonic phonons for each deformed structure.
    Finally, compute Gibb's free energy.

    Parameters
    ----------
    name: str
        Name of the flows produced by this maker.
    initial_relax_maker: .ForceFieldRelaxMaker | None
        Maker to relax the input structure.
    eos_relax_maker: .ForceFieldRelaxMaker | None
        Maker to relax deformed structures for the EOS fit.
        The volume has to be fixed!
    phonon_maker: .PhononMaker
        Maker to compute phonons. The volume has to be fixed!
        The beforehand relaxation could be switched off.
    linear_strain: tuple[float, float]
        Percentage linear strain to apply as a deformation, default = -5% to 5%.
    number_of_frames: int
        Number of strain calculations to do for EOS fit, default = 6.
    t_max: float | None
        Maximum temperature until which the QHA will be performed
    pressure: float | None
        Pressure at which the QHA will be performed (default None, no pressure)
    skip_analysis: bool
        Skips the analysis step and only performs EOS and phonon computations.
    ignore_imaginary_modes: bool
        By default, volumes where the harmonic phonon approximation shows imaginary
        will be ignored
    eos_type: supported_eos
        Equation of State type used for the fitting. Defaults to vinet.
    min_length: float
        min length of the supercell that will be built
    max_length: float
        max length of the supercell that will be built
    prefer_90_degrees: bool
        if set to True, supercell algorithm will first try to find a supercell
        with 3 90 degree angles
    get_supercell_size_kwargs: dict
        kwargs that will be passed to get_supercell_size to determine supercell size

@dataclass
class FormationEnergyMaker(Maker, ABC):
    """Maker class to help calculate of the formation energy diagram.

    Maker class to calculate formation energy diagrams. The main settings for
    this maker is the `defect_relax_maker` which contains the settings for the atomic
    relaxations that each defect supercell will undergo.

    Attributes
    ----------
    defect_relax_maker: Maker
        A maker to perform a atomic-position-only relaxation on the defect charge
        states. Since these calculations are expensive and the settings might get
        messy, it is recommended for each implementation of this maker to check
        some of the most important settings in the `relax_maker`.  Please see
        `FormationEnergyMaker.validate_maker` for more details.

    bulk_relax_maker: Maker
        If None, the same `defect_relax_maker` will be used for the bulk supercell.
        A maker to used to perform the bulk supercell calculation. For marginally
        converged calculations, it might be desirable to perform an additional
        lattice relaxation on the bulk supercell to make sure the energies are more
        reliable. However, if you do relax the bulk supercell, you can inadvertently
        change the grid size used in the calculation and thus the representation
        of the electrostatic potential which will affect calculation of the Freysoldt
        finite-size correction. Therefore, if you do want to perform a bulk supercell
        lattice relaxation, you should manually set the grid size.

        .. code-block:: python
            relax_set = MPRelaxSet(defect.get_supercell_structure())
            ng, ngf = relax_set.calculate_ng()
            params = ["NGX", "NGY", "NGZ", "NGXF", "NGYF", "NGZF"]
            ng_settings = dict(zip(params, ng + ngf))
            relax_maker = update_user_incar_settings(relax_maker, ng_settings)

    name: str
        The name of the flow created by this maker.

    relax_radius:
        The radius to include around the defect site for the relaxation.
        If "auto", the radius will be set to the maximum that will fit inside
        a periodic cell. If None, all atoms will be relaxed.

    perturb:
        The amount to perturb the sites in the supercell. Only perturb the
        sites with selective dynamics set to True. So this setting only works
        with `relax_radius`.

    validate_charge: bool
        Whether to validate the charge of the defect. If True (default), the charge
        of the output structure will have to match the charge of the input defect.
        This helps catch situations where the charge of the output defect is either
        improperly set or improperly parsed before the data is stored in the
        database.

    collect_defect_entry_data: bool
        Whether to collect the defect entry data at the end of the flow.
        If True, the output of all the charge states for each symmetry distinct
        defect will be collected into a list of dictionaries that can be used
        to create a DefectEntry. The data here can be trivially combined with
        phase diagram data from the materials project API to create the formation
        energy diagrams.

        .. note::
        Once we remove the requirement for explicit bulk supercell calculations,
        this setting will be removed.  It is only needed because the bulk supercell
        locpot is currently needed for the finite-size correction calculation.

        Output format for the DefectEntry data:

            {
                'bulk_dir_name': 'computer1:/folder1',

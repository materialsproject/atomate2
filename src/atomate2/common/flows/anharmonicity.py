        Parameters
        ----------
        structure: Structure
            A pymatgen structure object. Please start with a structure
            that is nearly fully optimized as the internal optimizers
            have very strict settings!
        prev_dir: Optional[str | Path]
            A previous calculation directory to use for copying outputs.
            Default is None.
        born: Optional[list[Matrix3D]]
            Instead of recomputing Born charges and epsilon, these values can also be
            provided manually. If born and epsilon_static are provided, the born run
            will be skipped it can be provided in the VASP convention with information
            for every atom in unit cell. Please be careful when converting structures
            within in this workflow as this could lead to errors. The default for this
            field is None.
        epsilon_static: Optional[Matrix3D]
            The high-frequency dielectric constant to use instead of recomputing born
            charges and epsilon. If born, epsilon_static are provided, the born run
            will be skipped. The default for this field is None.
        total_dft_energy_per_formula_unit: Optional[float]
            It has to be given per formula unit (as a result in corresponding Doc).
            Instead of recomputing the energy of the bulk structure every time, this
            value can also be provided in eV. If it is provided, the static run will be
            skipped. This energy is the typical output dft energy of the dft workflow.
            No conversion needed. It is set to 0 by default.
        supercell_matrix: Optional[Matrix3D]
            Instead of min_length, also a supercell_matrix can be given, e.g.
            [[1.0,0.0,0.0],[0.0,1.0,0.0],[0.0,0.0,1.0]]. By default, this matrix is
            set to None.
        temperature: float
            The temperature for the anharmonicity calculation. The default temp is 300.
        one_shot_approx: bool
            If true, finds the one shot approximation of sigma^A and if false, finds
            the full sigma^A. The default is True.
        seed: Optional[int]
            Seed to use for the random number generator
            (only used if one_shot_approx == False). Set to None by default.
        element_resolved: bool
            If true, calculate the atom-resolved sigma^A. This is false by default.
        mode_resolved: bool
            If true, calculate the mode-resolved sigma^A. This is false by default.
        site_resolved: bool
            If true, resolve sigma^A to the different sites.
            Default is false.
        n_samples: int
            Number of times displaced structures are sampled.
            Must be >= 1 and cannot be used when one_shot_approx == True.
            It is set to 1 by default.

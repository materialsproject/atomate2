class MagneticOrderingsMaker(Maker):
    """
    Maker to calculate possible collinear magnetic orderings for a material.

    Given an input structure, possible magnetic orderings will be enumerated and ranked based
    on symmetry up to a maximum number of orderings. Each ordering will be
    relaxed and a higher quality static calculation performed to obtain a total energy.
    The lowest energy ordering is the predicted ground-state collinear ordering. Note:
    to analyze the results of this workflow, use the corresponding builder for
    your DFT code (e.g., atomate2.vasp.builders.magnetism.MagneticOrderingsBuilder).

    This workflow showed decent performance using VASP for a wide range of test materials in a
    benchmark. It was originally implemented in atomate (v1) for VASP as the MagneticOrderingsWF.
    Please refer to the following paper for more information and cite appropriately:

        Horton, M.K., Montoya, J.H., Liu, M. et al. High-throughput prediction of the
        ground-state collinear magnetic order of inorganic materials using Density
        Functional Theory. npj Comput Mater 5, 64 (2019).

    .. Note::
        Good performance of this workflow is ultimately dependent on an appropriate
        choice of Hubbard U, Hund J values and/or the functional. The defaults will work
        well for many transition metal oxides.

    Parameters
    ----------
    name : str
        Name of the flows produced by this Maker.
    static_maker : Maker
        Maker used to peform static calculations for total energy (e.g.,
        atomate2.vasp.jobs.StaticMaker).
    relax_maker : Maker | None
        Maker used to perform relaxations of the enumerated structures (e.g.,
        atomate2.vasp.jobs.RelaxMaker). If None, relaxations will be skipped (i.e., only
        static calculations).
    default_magmoms : dict | None
        Optional default mapping of magnetic elements to their initial magnetic moments
        in ÂµB. Generally these are chosen to be high-spin, since they can relax to a
        low-spin configuration during a DFT electronic configuration. If None, will use
        the default values provided in pymatgen/analysis/magnetism/default_magmoms.yaml.
    strategies : tuple
        Different ordering strategies to use. Choose from ferromagnetic,
        antiferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic_by_motif, ferrimagnetic_by_motif,
        ferrimagnetic_by_species, or nonmagnetic. Here, "motif", means to use a
        different ordering parameter for symmetry inequivalent sites.
    automatic : bool
        If True, will automatically choose sensible strategies.
    truncate_by_symmetry : bool
        If True, will remove very unsymmetrical orderings that are likely physically
        implausible.
    transformation_kwargs : dict | None
        Keyword arguments provided to MagOrderingTransformation in pymatgen.

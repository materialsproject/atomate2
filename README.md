Atomate2 is a free, open-source software for performing complex materials science
workflows using simple Python functions. Features of atomate2 include

- It is built on open-source libraries: [pymatgen], [custodian], [jobflow], and
  [jobflow-remote] or [FireWorks].
- A library of "standard" workflows to compute a wide variety of desired materials
  properties.
- The ability scale from a single material, to 100 materials, or 100,000 materials.
- Easy routes to modifying and chaining workflows together.
- It can build large databases of output properties that you can query, analyze, and
  share in a systematic way.
- It automatically keeps meticulous records of jobs, their directories, runtime
  parameters, and more.

## Workflows

Some of the workflows available in atomate2 are:

- electronic band structures
- elastic, dielectric, and piezoelectric tensors
- one-shot electron-phonon interactions
- electronic transport using [AMSET]
- phonons using [phonopy]
- defect formation energy diagrams
- [Lobster] bonding analysis with [lobsterpy]

It is easy to customise and compose any of the above workflows.

## Quick start

Workflows in atomate2 are written using the [jobflow] library. Workflows are generated using
`Maker` objects which have a consistent API for modifying input settings and chaining
workflows together. Below, we demonstrate how to run a band structure workflow
(see the [documentation][RelaxBandStructure] for more details). In total, 4 VASP
calculations will be performed:

1. A structural optimisation.
2. A self-consistent static calculation on the relaxed geometry.
3. A non-self-consistent calculation on a uniform k-point mesh (for the density of
   states).
4. A non-self-consistent calculation on a high symmetry k-point path (for the line mode
   band structure).

```py
from atomate2.vasp.flows.core import RelaxBandStructureMaker
from jobflow import run_locally
from pymatgen.core import Structure

# construct a rock salt MgO structure
mgo_structure = Structure(
    lattice=[[0, 2.13, 2.13], [2.13, 0, 2.13], [2.13, 2.13, 0]],
    species=["Mg", "O"],
    coords=[[0, 0, 0], [0.5, 0.5, 0.5]],
)

# make a band structure flow to optimise the structure and obtain the band structure
bandstructure_flow = RelaxBandStructureMaker().make(mgo_structure)

# run the flow
run_locally(bandstructure_flow, create_folders=True)
```

Before the above code can run successfully, you'll need to

- tell pymatgen where to [find your pseudopotential files](https://pymatgen.org/installation.html#potcar-setup)
- tell atomate2 where to find your VASP binary
- (optionally) prepare an external database to store the job output

See the [installation] steps for details how to set all of this up.

In this example, we execute the workflow immediately. In many cases, you might want
to perform calculations on several materials simultaneously. To achieve this, all
atomate2 workflows can be run using the [jobflow-remote] or [FireWorks] software. See the
[jobflow-remote-specific documentation][atomate2-jobflow-remote] or [fireworks-specific documentation][atomate2_fireworks] for more details.

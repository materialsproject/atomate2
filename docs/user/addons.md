# Add-ons for `atomate2`

## Applications

`atomate2` contains, in its github source, a set of applications which use the tools in `atomate2` to build more focused workflows. An example of a MOF screening pipeline is included there. If you have developed a complex workflow which focuses on a specific class of materials/molecules, or may be less "generic" than the core `atomate2` tools, this is a great space to contribute them!

## Add-ons

Matgenix has kindly created an [add-on template](https://github.com/Matgenix/atomate2-addon-template) for `atomate2`. You can use this template to add a submodule with new code features for `atomate2` without contributing back to the source code. This is a useful tool when developing a new set of workflows, or if your development work has access restrictions that might conflict with the open-source license of `atomate2`.

Some add ons for `atomate2` are:
- [An extension to turbomole from Matgenix](https://github.com/Matgenix/atomate2-turbomole)
- [An extension to LAMMPs from Matgenix](https://github.com/Matgenix/atomate2-lammps). This feature set is currently being migrated into the core features of `atomate2`.

Contributors are welcome to include their add-ons here!

<b>`atomate2` is an open-source code used worldwide and primarily supported by public funding. We strongly encourage those using `atomate2` to eventually contribute their extensions / add-ons back to the main source of `atomate2` if usage restrictions permit it.</b>

    "### Understanding Atomate2 OpenMM \n",
    "\n",
    "Atomate2 is really just a collection of jobflow workflows relevant to materials science. In all the workflows, we pass our system of interest between different jobs to perform the desired simulation. Representing the intermediate state of a classical molecular dynamics simulation, however, is challenging. While the intermediate representation between stages of a periodic DFT simulation can include just the elements, xyz coordinates, and box vectors, classical molecular dynamics systems must also include velocities and forces. The latter is particularly challenging because all MD engines represent forces differently. Rather than implement our own representation, we use the `openff.interchange.Interchange` object, which catalogs the necessary system properties and interfaces with a variety of MD engines. This is the object that we pass between stages of a classical MD simulation and it is the starting point of our workflow."

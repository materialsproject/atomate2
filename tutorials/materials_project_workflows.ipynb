    "## Running Materials Project Compatible workflows using VASP / DFT\n",
    "\n",
    "As of early 2025, the majority of the calculations in the [Materials Project (MP) database](https://next-gen.materialsproject.org/materials) are performed with [PBE GGA](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.77.3865) and PBE+<i>U</i> density funcitonal theory (DFT) calculations, with about a quarter coming from [r<sup>2</sup>SCAN calculations](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpclett.0c02405) instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, you will use the Materials Project workflows and corrections/mixing schemes for [PBE and PBE+<i>U</i>](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.84.045115), and for [r<sup>2</sup>SCAN](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41524-022-00881-w), to generate a partial compositional phase diagram for the V-O compositional space. The mixing and corrections schemes are used to better align PBE, PBE+<i>U</i>, and r<sup>2</sup>SCAN convex hulls, and to correct known errors in approximate DFT to predict more accurate enthalpies of formation.\n",
    "\n",

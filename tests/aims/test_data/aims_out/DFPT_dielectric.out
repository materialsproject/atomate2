  Using libxc - Initializing
  Libxc version: 5.1.7


  ** PLEASE ** be careful using LibXC. Whilst most of the LDA, GGA and MGGA functionals,
  and hybrid variations therein, should be stable (though we always recommend testing!),
  there are several fancy functionals with e.g. range-separation, like HSE03/HSE06/LC-PBEh,
  and also MGGA functionals that depend on the laplacian of the density, like BR89,
  that are not fully implemented due to the infrastrucutre for these functionals being incomplete or non-generic.
  If you want to use these functionals please contact the development team and we will work on them with you!

  Final output of selected total energy values:

  The following output summarizes some interesting total energy values
  at the end of a run (AFTER all relaxation, molecular dynamics, etc.).

  | Total energy of the DFT / Hartree-Fock s.c.f. calculation      :          -7483.998547862 eV
  | Final zero-broadening corrected energy (caution - metals only) :          -7483.998547862 eV
  | For reference only, the value of 1 Hartree used in FHI-aims is :             27.211384500 eV
  | For reference only, the overall average (free atom contribution
  | + realspace contribution) of the electrostatic potential after
  | s.c.f. convergence is                                          :            -16.001261159 eV

  Before relying on these values, please be sure to understand exactly which
  total energy value is referred to by a given number. Different objects may
  all carry the same name 'total energy'. Definitions:

  Total energy of the DFT / Hartree-Fock s.c.f. calculation:
  | Note that this energy does not include ANY quantities calculated after the
  | s.c.f. cycle, in particular not ANY RPA, MP2, etc. many-body perturbation terms.

  Final zero-broadening corrected energy:
  | For metallic systems only, a broadening of the occupation numbers at the Fermi
  | level can be extrapolated back to zero broadening by an electron-gas inspired
  | formula. For all systems that are not real metals, this value can be
  | meaningless and should be avoided.

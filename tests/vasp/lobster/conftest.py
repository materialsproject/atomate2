    """
    This fixture allows one to mock (fake) running LOBSTER.
    It works by monkeypatching (replacing) calls to run_lobster that will
    work when the lobster executables
    are not present.
    The primary idea is that instead of running LOBSTER to generate the output files,
    reference files will be copied into the directory instead. As we do not want to
    test whether LOBSTER is giving the correct output rather that the calculation inputs
    are generated correctly and that the outputs are parsed properly, this should be
    sufficient for our needs.
    To use the fixture successfully, the following steps must be followed:
    1. "mock_lobster" should be included as an argument to any test that would
        like to use its functionally.
    2. For each job in your workflow, you should prepare a reference directory
       containing two folders "inputs" (containing the reference input files
       expected to be produced by Lobsterin.standard_calculations_from_vasp_files
       and "outputs" (containing the expected
       output files to be produced by run_lobster). These files should reside in a
       subdirectory of "tests/test_data/lobster".
    3. Create a dictionary mapping each job name to its reference directory.
       Note that you should supply the reference directory relative to the
       "tests/test_data/lobster" folder. For example, if your calculation
       has one job named "lobster_run_0" and the reference files are present in
       "tests/test_data/lobster/Si_lobster_run_0", the dictionary
       would look like: ``{"lobster_run_0": "Si_lobster_run_0"}``.
    4. Optional: create a dictionary mapping each job name to custom
       keyword arguments that will be supplied to fake_run_lobster.
       This way you can configure which lobsterin settings are expected for each job.
       For example, if your calculation has one job named "lobster_run_0"
       and you wish to validate that "basisfunctions" is set correctly
       in the lobsterin, your dictionary would look like
       ``{"lobster_run_0": {"lobsterin_settings": {"basisfunctions": Ba 5p 5s 6s}}``.
    5. Inside the test function, call `mock_lobster(ref_paths, fake_lobster_kwargs)`,
       where ref_paths is the dictionary created in step 3
       and fake_lobster_kwargs is the
       dictionary created in step 4.
    6. Run your lobster job after calling `mock_lobster`.
